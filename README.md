# AI Voice Agent for Lead Nurturing ðŸš€

## Description

This project is an AI Voice Agent designed to interact with prospects through voice conversations, collect relevant information, and improve lead segmentation and personalization. The assistant leverages pre-trained language models and speech recognition to understand user intent, extract key information, and provide helpful responses.

## Features

1. LLM Integration

    * Utilizes GPT and Whisper for text and voice processing.

    * Implements LangChain to manage conversation flow.

    * Loads, processes, and customizes models for personalized responses.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    * Detects user intent (e.g., product interest, service inquiries, specific requirements).

    * Extracts key information such as name, company, needs, and estimated budget.

3. Voice Interaction

    * Uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert spoken responses into text.

    * Implements text-to-speech (TTS) to generate voice responses.

    * Maintains conversation context across multiple interactions.

4. Intelligent Dialogue Flow

    * Guides the lead through a structured conversation.

    * Enriches the lead profile by integrating relevant information effectively.

5. CRM & Database Integration

    * Stores and updates lead information in a CRM or database.

    * Manages authentication, CRM API interaction, and data synchronization.

6. Error Handling & Ambiguity Resolution

    * Detects and corrects user input errors.

    * Requests clarification naturally when needed.

7. Testing

    * Implements unit tests to verify system components.

## Project Structure

```bash
voice-ai-agent/
â”‚-- pdf/                    # Pdfs from the company, to complete missing information, and save into Vector DB
â”‚-- src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py              # Entry point, UI rendering (Streamlit), message handling
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py            # LLM integration with different tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database.py         # Database management (Vector DB & SQL DB)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py           # Configuration settings (keys, properties, paths)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ html_templates.py   # HTML templates for Streamlit
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ validator.py        # Name validation using LLM
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py            # Utility functions to serve different components
â”‚-- tests/                  # Unit tests
â”‚-- README.md               # Project documentation
```

Also, there are some folders that will be generated once the system is running:

```bash
â”‚-- audio/                  # Save the last user and bot audio
â”‚-- chroma/                 # The in memory vector DB, to save pdf and web information about the company
â”‚-- chatbot_db.sqlite/      # Relational DB, to save basic user information
```
